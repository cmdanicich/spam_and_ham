Data Set Share #1

This dataset was found via The Medium after googling open source text datasets. I chose this file after we had discussed AI bots in class and thought this was a simple way of relating to that concept. 

This dataset contains 747 "spam" sms messages and 4827 "ham" sms messages from varying sources. 

Spam is defined as “the use of electronic messaging systems to send unsolicited bulk messages, especially advertising, indiscriminately” wheras Ham is defined as "email that is generally desired and isn't considered spam." The main difference between the two is that Ham messages are "subscribed" and are therefore "desired." This can be misleading because one can directly and indirectly subscribe to Ham messages unintentionally. An example of subscribing to Ham directly is when you check the "Yes! I would like to receive newsletters from brand abc." 

Either way you look at it, these messages are automated and are sent in mass quantities much like Twitter bots.
