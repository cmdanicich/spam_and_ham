What to Submit

Data Set
Submit the actual data. You can do this with a file upload to Moodle if the data set is under 500 MB. If your data is available publicly, 
feel free to share it via a link. If your data is too big to upload, you can submit it via a Box/DropBox/Drive link as well.  

Write up
I’d like a short write up about your data set, that should include the following sections: 
1.	Data set source: where did you find the data? What prompted you to seek it out? 
2.	Data set description: What are the basic facts about the data? How was it generated? Does it have any known limitations? 
3.	Descriptive statistics: Give us a basic feel for the data set. How big is it? How many different “units” 
    (conversations/reviews/pages/etc) are there? How many tokens? Etc. This is a good time to mention anything that might be idiosyncratic in the data, 
    such as special cleaning needs (things like acronyms or proper nouns or emojis). 
4.	Interesting questions: List some interesting questions we could answer by analyzing these data. 
5.	Approach for a single question: For one of your questions, outline what steps you’d need to take to answer it. 
    Use techniques like those we discuss in the class. 

Link to GitHub Repo (Optional)
Many of you will probably use code to assemble the data set, whether via an API or web scraping. 
If you use code, please put that code in a GitHub repository (not part of our Classroom account—part of your personal GitHub account). 
Share a link to that repository. Make sure your code conforms to our style guides and includes comments.
